1. Read the log file: Read each line and extract relevant information.

2. Track start and end times: Store job details using a Map where the key is the PID.

3. Compute durations: Calculate the difference between START and END timestamps.

4. Categorize logs:
Log a warning if the duration exceeds 5 minutes.
Log an error if the duration exceeds 10 minutes.

5. Generate a report: Print or write to a log file.
